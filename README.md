# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation with UFO Data

Background:  For a collection of eye-witness reports of UFO sightings, allow users to filter this collection of data to find those sightings they are intersted in seeing.

* Step 1:  Append the table to a webpage and allow users to filter by the date of the sighting.
* Step 2:  Build in additional filters so users can search by a variety of items:  date, city, state, country and/or shape of the sighting.
